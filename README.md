# MOD19-ProgressiveWebApp-Text-Editor
Task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. Single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. Will also function offline.
